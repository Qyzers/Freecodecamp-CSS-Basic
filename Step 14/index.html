<!--You have styled three elements by writing CSS inside the style tags. This works, but since there will be many more styles, it's best to put all the styles in a separate file and link to it.-->

<!--We have created a separate styles.css file for you and switched the editor view to that file. You can change between files with the tabs at the top of the editor.-->

<!--Start by rewriting the styles you have created into the styles.css file. Make sure to exclude the opening and closing style tags.-->
