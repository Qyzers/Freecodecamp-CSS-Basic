<!--It would be nice if the vertical space between the h2 elements and their associated icons was smaller. The h2 elements have default top and bottom margin space, so you could change the bottom margin of the h2 elements to say 0 or another number.-->

<!--There is an easier way, simply add a negative top margin to the img elements to pull them up from their current positions. Negative values are created using a - in front of the value. To complete this project, go ahead and use a negative top margin of 25px in the img type selector.-->


img {
display: block;
margin-left: auto;
margin-right: auto;
margin-top: -25px;
}
